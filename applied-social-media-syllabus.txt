“The thing you use for play is also the thing you use for work,” Paul Jones, UNC
The Applied Social Media class delivers practical, hands-on skills and experience applying social media best practices to journalism. Students gain a first-hand understanding social media trends, issues and implementation strategies. Demonstrable journalistic social media expertise is a premium skill in this job market. 
Students in the ASM class apply metrics-focused training to develop new sources, identity story ideas and trends, and to curate high-value content. Every student will use social media to build a professional online identity. Students will maintain lively social media accounts and will use social media as vital component of a complete news and community engagement plan. 
The class will leverage assigned reading and videos, original writing and guest lecturers. Primary evaluation criteria will be success of individual branding efforts and the measured performance of individual and team social media assignments. 
Because this class only meets 15 times, your attendance and participation is essential to our mutual success of this class and the instructors discourage you from taking the class if your spring schedule is especially time-stressed to the point where your active participation is uncertain.

Advance Notification of Live-Tweet Assignment due on Feb. 16 (See Feb. 2 class assignments)
January 26: Social Media—Scale, Scope and Context.
Bill Gannon will present a lecture that places the social media landscape into context and provide the class with a deep understanding of the size and scope of social media today.
The lecture will be followed by a student-by-student review of your assignment to write a series of posts or an article on social media and digital privacy. Lets discuss your understanding, perspective and comfort levels and just how much you think others understand about exactly what lies within the Facebook and Google+ Terms of Service.
We'll then focus on how you can leverage an RSS reader and simple news alerts to help you keep abreast of a wide range of news and issues. Each year we're somewhat alarmed at the number of students who do not leverage these easy-to-use tools.
"There’s no such thing as information overload, there’s only filter failure.” Jay Rosen, NYU.
RSS 
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an Internet feed format used to publish frequently updated works usually news and blog headlines, but also audio and video in a single format or "feed". These feeds usually include text, metadata and sometimes images and video. The primary benefit of using an RSS reader is basically to address the issue of keeping up with the accelerated pace of news and information in a social media world.
RSS feeds leverage a simple XML data format and can be captured using free services such as RSS readers and have been around for more than a decade. All you have to do to subscribe to a feed is to enter the specific feed's URI or by simple clicking the RSS icon.
Please note there are many RSS readers out there but our top recommendations are:
Google Reader: http://bit.ly/7inepi
My Yahoo: http://my.yahoo.com/
NewsGator's Feed Demon: http://www.newsgator.com/rss-readers.aspx
News Alerts 
If you have not used an RSS Reader before, we're equally concerned you may not be using Google or Yahoo! News alerts yet and either one is invaluable and completely essential for keeping up with specific topics - or people you are following. 
Google News Alerts: http://www.google.com/alerts?f=0&hl=en&gl=us
Yahoo! News Alerts: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/alerts/news/
Lastly, Jerry Monti will introduce you to a series of practices and tools to help you identify and then measure your personal brand goals, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and tracking and measurement tools. Class participants will set personal targets.
Assignment due by Wednesday Feb. 2
Review, evaluate, and then install and use an RSS reader and subscribe to/add at least 12 feeds to your chosen RSS reader and post at least five tweets using the #jcalsocial hash tag about your RSS experience. Includes feeds from sites focused on use of social media and journalism and from sites focused on social media and branding.
Assignment due by Wednesday Feb. 2
Create at least five news alerts of your choice. Two of these alerts must be your full name and your byline so you can keep track of your social media and web profile. Create two alerts related to your job target.
